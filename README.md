# HeI10830-Reconstruction
This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and trained models for the paper “Reconstructing He I 10830 Å Images Using Hα Images through Deep Learning.”
The project demonstrates how convolutional neural networks can infer chromospheric He I emission from Hα input, enabling historical reconstructions and enhanced solar diagnostics.
